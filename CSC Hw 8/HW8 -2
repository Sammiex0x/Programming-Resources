Where do you go to find help on javascript questions? Letâ€™s say you want to find information on how promises work in ES6. What does that mean? Make a list of at least 3 resources you consulted in finding that answer.


For  javascript questions I usually review the slides from class or go to w3schools. 
I like w3schools because it gives you examples and lets you run the code. 
Promises represent a value that we can handle at some point in the future. It tells us what we can handle in the future value.
Mainly that it can not be undone, so like a failsafe.
They give us a much better way to control synced programming at the same time.

Imagine you are working on a problem with using git to merge files from another contributor on your project. 
What resources can you find to help you understand git merge? On your system, what editor gets launched to show merges? 
How do you use it to edit text, save, and exit?

I do not need to imagine this issue... it happened on project #2. It is easiest to communicate with eachother.
PULL before you make changes and make sure to push up all changes. TALK To your team and make sure you aren't editing the same file.



Resources for Git Merge:

Git mergetool launches to resolve merge conflicts after the merge.
The tool will automatically edit texts with errors. 
Then when it is closed it will save the changes.
