I like this resource because it gives a simple answer and then a more detailed answer which is still easy to follow.

I like this resource because it not only explains the backend server, it explains the differences between them.

SQL and noSQL, while researching this, I see there is a huge debate on this! from what I could tell there is no better one, just what the programmer wants to use.
SQL does seem to be more popluar though but noSQL is making its way up!

SQL are called Relational Databases (RDBMS) whereas 
NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

SQL uses rows and coloums to sort information like a table.
NoSQL does not use a table to standardize information

SQL databases have predefined schemas
NoSQL does not have predefined schemas for unstructured data.

This is actually a 3 part video but I always look to youtube first when trying to understand something.
I learn best through examples and being shown as well and told about something. Thats what I like it when you record
our lectures with your computer screen shared so I can see and hear!
